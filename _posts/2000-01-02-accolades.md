#### Basically

# I am a top performer who will get things done.  Don't just take my word for it though.

> Stephanie is a very talented young PM, she manages her time like a pro and is excellent at technical details. Stephanie was a pleasure to work with and not intimidated by new challenges. She can take on several projects simultaneously. I would love to work with Stephanie again, she would be a top choice in building any project team.
